# Welcome to the example hologram style guide!

This style guide and the examples given within are based off of [Trulia](http://trulia.com)'s own css library and style guide.

There are a couple of things to note as you poke around.

1. The example css given is stripped from our own library. We use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) at Trulia and instead of making these examples depend on Sass we've just included the compiled css for a couple of components. If the organization looks a little weird and the components don't seem to have exactly the css you would expect it's because they look nothing like the Sass that spawned them.

3. This is a work in progress, please consider contributing to [hologram](http://github.com/trulia/hologram).

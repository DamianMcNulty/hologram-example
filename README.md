# Example hologram style guide

This style guide is an example of the type of style guide that can be created using [hologram](http://github.com/trulia/hologram).

**Please keep the following in mind as you look at this example:**

1. The goal of hologram is to make it easy to document your CSS and to display code examples that are powered by that CSS. Hologram has no opinions about how you should actually organize/style your style guide. You could do everything as a single file with no header/footer and it would work just fine. Or, you could break it up into an individual file for each component. Top navigation, left navigation, no navigation....that's up to you. Build it however you'd like.

2. The actual styling and examples shown here are based off of [Trulia](http://trulia.com)'s own CSS library and style guide. For usage instructions see the [hologram repository](http://github.com/trulia/hologram).

3. The example CSS given is stripped from our own library. We use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) at Trulia and instead of making these examples depend on Sass we've just included the compiled CSS for a couple of components. If the organization looks a little weird and the components don't seem to have exactly the CSS you would expect it's because they look nothing like the Sass that spawned them.

4. This is a work in progress, please consider contributing to [hologram](http://github.com/trulia/hologram).
